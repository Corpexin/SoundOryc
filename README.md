# SoundOryc

SoundOryc is a music streaming player. **Free, no Ads, up to 320 kbps & Open Source**.

###Free
No premium, no payments, no restrictions. Enjoy the complete catalog and forget those 9,99$/m.

###No Ads
We hate ads, we don't need them. And obviously we will not interrupt you with sound ads.

###Up to 320 kbps
Yep, our catalog uses engines with 320 kbps support. And there's a good amount of 320 kbps songs!

###Open Source
You can fork, copy, modify, and upload your own version if you want. Just don't break the GPL V3 rules ;)


How it works?
  - Search your favourite songs
  - Get the listAmet, voluptatem, eligendi id, mollitia vel at sed sequi anim dolor.
  - Enjoy listening

You can also:
  - Use 2 different search engines
  - Download every song you want
  - Create and modify your own playlists

Inspired by [Fildo], (in fact the first idea was to create a Windows version of Fildo) SoundOryc use the Netease Catalog + Mp3With Catalog. No links are hosted. In fact, we don't have a proper host ;)

### Requirements
 - Microsoft Windows 7/8/8.1/10 (not tested with others)
 - .NET Framework x.x
 - Windows Media Player correctly installed (we use some libs)
